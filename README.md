## 🚀 What We Built

A complete payment infrastructure that solves **merchant privacy** problems on Solana by combining:

1. **Light Protocol ZK Compression**
   - 99.7% cost savings (no rent for compressed tokens)
   - Merkle tree commitments for privacy
   - Zero-knowledge validity proofs

2. **Selective Disclosure Receipts**
   - Cryptographic commitment proofs
   - Payers choose which fields to reveal
   - SHA256 commitments + nonces

3. **Helius Infrastructure**
   - Enhanced Transactions for compressed token detection
   - Webhooks for instant payment confirmation
   - Priority fees for optimal UX

---

## 💡 The Problem

**Merchant Privacy on Solana:**
- Competitors can track wallet balances and sales volumes
- Payment amounts are publicly visible
- High storage costs (~0.002 SOL rent per token account)
- No way to prove payments without exposing all details

**Example:** A freelancer receives payment via PayLink. They need to prove income to their accountant but don't want to reveal:
- Their client's wallet address
- Other clients they work with
- Full transaction history

---

## ✨ Our Solution

### 1. Create Privacy-Enhanced PayLink
```
Merchant Dashboard → New PayLink
                  → Privacy: "Light Protocol ZK Compression"
                  → Amount: 1 SOL
                  → Creates compressed account
```

### 2. Pay with Compressed Tokens (99.7% cheaper!)
```
Payer → Visits PayLink URL
      → Wallet connection
      → Pay with compressed tokens
      → Only 128-byte ZK proof on-chain
      → No rent required!
```

### 3. Automatic Receipt Issuance
```
Helius Webhook → Detects payment
              → Backend verifies ZK proof
              → Generates cryptographic receipt
              → Commitment: SHA256(facts + nonce)
```

### 4. Selective Disclosure
```
Payer → Open receipt
      → Toggle fields to reveal:
         [✓] Amount: 1 SOL
         [✓] Token: SOL
         [ ] Merchant: HIDDEN
         [ ] Invoice: HIDDEN
         [ ] PayLink ID: HIDDEN
      → Generate proof
      → Download JSON
      → Share with verifier
```

### 5. Proof Verification
```
Verifier → Upload proof JSON
         → System verifies:
            ✓ Commitment hash matches
            ✓ Nonce is valid
            ✓ Only revealed fields shown
         → Result: "Valid 1 SOL payment"
         → Hidden fields stay protected
```
